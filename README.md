## 👋 Hi, I'm Jasjot Parmar

I'm an aspiring data engineer with ~2 years of hands-on experience in **Python**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **PySpark**. Most recently, I worked as a **Data Analyst in healthcare**, where I supported data-driven decision making by building dashboards, cleaning complex datasets, and uncovering insights that helped physicians improve patient outcomes.

In Fall 2025, I will be starting my **Master of Science in Analytics** at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, continuing my journey toward becoming a full-fledged data engineer.

I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful action — whether it's optimizing ETL processes, uncovering patterns in complex health data, or predicting real-world outcomes with machine learning.


### 🔍 Featured Projects

- [📊 Reddit Data Engineering Trends Pipeline](https://github.com/jasjotp/reddit-tldr-dataengineering)  
  **Python, Apache Airflow, Word2Vec, KMeans, Hugging Face, AWS S3**  
  • Built a daily Airflow ETL pipeline to ingest and process posts from `r/dataengineering`, enabling continuous topic discovery and trend analysis.  
  • Applied Word2Vec, BERTopic, KMeans clustering, and sentiment analysis (DistilBERT) to uncover high-engagement themes and generate post-level recommendations.  
  • Uploaded daily insights, cluster visualizations, and enriched post data to Amazon S3, supporting exploration of trending data engineering discussions
  
- [🧠 Automated Classification and Severity Grading of Lung Cancer](https://github.com/jasjotp/Lung-Cancer-Classification-and-Detection)  
  **Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, scikit-learn**  
  • Improved lung cancer classification accuracy to **95%** by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch, automating the analysis of microscopic lung tissue images to assist in early cancer detection.  
  • Engineered a cancer cell detection algorithm using OpenCV, enabling analysis of **15,000+ X-ray images** with **95% accuracy**.

- [🛒 Amazon Customer Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jasjotp/amazon_customer_review_sentiment_analysis)  
  **Python, VADER, DistilBERT, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLP**  
  • Analyzed **568K+ Amazon Fine Food reviews (1999–2012)** using both rule-based (VADER) and transformer-based (DistilBERT) models to uncover trends in customer satisfaction.  
  • Built quarterly time-series visualizations and computed sentiment-star rating correlations, identifying that **DistilBERT detects declining satisfaction** over time, while **VADER shows stable or increasing positivity**.  
  • Achieved a comprehensive comparison of model performance, showing **only 22.7% agreement** and a **Pearson correlation of 0.11**, highlighting their complementary nature.  
  • Extracted word clouds and top token frequencies by rating level to expose key themes and pain points, enabling data-driven product feedback analysis.

- [📈 YouTube Trending Video Analysis and Predictive Modelling](https://github.com/jasjotp/Predicting-YouTube-TrendingVideo-Factors)  
  **Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, NumPy**  
  • Applied hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and classification to identify key drivers of YouTube video popularity.  
  • Built a Random Forest Classifier (**98.7% accuracy**) to predict how often a video will trend based on features like tags, likes, and comments.

- [🌎 World Layoffs Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasjotp/world_layoffs_data_analysis)  
  **SQL, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  • Performed full data cleaning and transformation of a global layoffs dataset.  
  • Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover trends by country, industry, stage, and time.  
  • Built logic to identify companies at high risk using layoffs per funding raised and operational patterns.

- [🎮 Snakes and Ladders Multiplayer Game](https://github.com/qiandyq/snakesandladders)  
  **Python, Socket Programming, OOP**  
  • Designed and developed a full multiplayer Snakes and Ladders game using client-server architecture.  
  • Implemented game logic, player synchronization, and real-time interactions between multiple users over a network.
