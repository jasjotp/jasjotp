## 👋 Hi, I'm Jasjot Parmar

I'm an aspiring data scientist with hands-on experience in **Python**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **PySpark**. Currently, I work as a **Data Analyst in healthcare**, where I support data-driven decision making by building dashboards, cleaning complex datasets, and uncovering insights that improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency.

In Fall 2025, I will be starting my **Master of Science in Analytics** at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, continuing my journey toward becoming a full-fledged data scientist.

I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful action — whether it's optimizing ETL processes, uncovering patterns in complex health data, or predicting real-world outcomes with machine learning.
