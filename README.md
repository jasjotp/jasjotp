## üëã Hi, I'm Jasjot Parmar

I'm a data professional with ~2 years of hands-on experience in **Python**, **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **PySpark**. Most recently, I worked as a **Data Analyst in healthcare**, where I supported data-driven decision making by building dashboards, cleaning complex datasets, and uncovering insights that helped physicians improve patient outcomes.

In Fall 2025, I will be starting my **Master of Science in Analytics** at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, continuing my journey toward becoming a full-fledged data engineer or data scientist.

I‚Äôm passionate about turning raw data into meaningful action ‚Äî whether it's optimizing ETL processes, uncovering patterns in complex health data, or predicting real-world outcomes with machine learning.


### üîç Featured Projects

- [üí∏ Anomaly Detection Pipeline for Real-Time Financial Transactions](https://github.com/jasjotp/fraud_detection)  
  **Python, PySpark, Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, XGBoost, MLflow, MinIO**
  
  - Designed and deployed a real-time fraud detection pipeline using **PySpark**, **Apache Kafka**, and **Airflow**, automating fraud alerting with rule-based logic and model re-training to support real-time anomaly detection for financial transactions.
  - Engineered **30+** behavioral, temporal, and statistical features and used **SMOTE** and **Optuna** to optimize an **XGBoost** model, boosting fraud detection recall to **98%** on imbalanced data while tracking performance in **MLflow**.
  - Logged model runs, metrics, and artifacts to **MLflow** and designed modular components for scalable deployment, supporting anomaly detection at production scale.

- [üìä TL;DR: What's Trending on r/dataengineering?](https://github.com/jasjotp/reddit-tldr-dataengineering)  
  **Python, Apache Airflow, Word2Vec, KMeans, Hugging Face, AWS S3**
  
  - Built a daily **Airflow data pipeline** to ingest and process posts from `r/dataengineering`, enabling continuous topic discovery and trend analysis.  
  - Applied **Word2Vec**, **BERTopic**, **KMeans** clustering, and **sentiment analysis** (DistilBERT) to uncover high-engagement themes and generate post-level recommendations.  
  - Uploaded daily insights, cluster visualizations, and enriched post data to **Amazon S3**, supporting exploration of trending data engineering discussions.

- [üè† Real-Time Real Estate Streaming Pipeline](https://github.com/jasjotp/RealEstate_Streaming_Pipeline)  
  **Python, Spark Structured Streaming, Apache Kafka, Docker Compose, Cassandra, Playwright, OpenAI GPT-4o**

  - Built a real-time data pipeline using **Spark Structured Streaming**, **Apache Kafka**, and **Docker Compose** to scrape and transform property listings from Zoopla, storing structured records in **Cassandra** for downstream querying.
  - Automated property detail extraction from raw HTML using **Playwright** and **OpenAI GPT-4o**, augmenting listing data with fields like beds, price, and square footage before streaming to **Kafka** for processing.

- [üß† Automated Classification and Severity Grading of Lung Cancer](https://github.com/jasjotp/Lung-Cancer-Classification-and-Detection)  
  **Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, scikit-learn**
  
  - Improved lung cancer classification accuracy to **95%** by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch, automating the analysis of microscopic lung tissue images to assist in early cancer detection.  
  - Engineered a cancer cell detection algorithm using OpenCV, enabling analysis of **15,000+ X-ray images** with **95% accuracy**.

- [üõí Amazon Customer Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jasjotp/amazon_customer_review_sentiment_analysis)  
  **Python, VADER, DistilBERT, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLP**
  
  - Analyzed **568K+ Amazon Fine Food reviews (1999‚Äì2012)** using both rule-based (VADER) and transformer-based (DistilBERT) models to uncover trends in customer satisfaction.  
  - Built quarterly time-series visualizations and computed sentiment-star rating correlations, identifying that **DistilBERT detects declining satisfaction** over time, while **VADER shows stable or increasing positivity**.  
  - Achieved a comprehensive comparison of model performance, showing **only 22.7% agreement** and a **Pearson correlation of 0.11**, highlighting their complementary nature.  
  - Extracted word clouds and top token frequencies by rating level to expose key themes and pain points, enabling data-driven product feedback analysis.

- [üìà YouTube Trending Video Analysis and Predictive Modelling](https://github.com/jasjotp/Predicting-YouTube-TrendingVideo-Factors)  
  **Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, NumPy**
  
  - Applied hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and classification to identify key drivers of YouTube video popularity.  
  - Built a Random Forest Classifier (**95% accuracy**) to predict how often a video will trend based on features like tags, likes, and comments.

- [üåé World Layoffs Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasjotp/world_layoffs_data_analysis)  
  **SQL, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis**
  
  - Performed full data cleaning and transformation of a global layoffs dataset.  
  - Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover trends by country, industry, stage, and time.  
  - Built logic to identify companies at high risk using layoffs per funding raised and operational patterns.

- [üéÆ Snakes and Ladders Multiplayer Game](https://github.com/qiandyq/snakesandladders)  
  **Python, Socket Programming, OOP**
  
  - Designed and developed a full multiplayer Snakes and Ladders game using client-server architecture.  
  - Implemented game logic, player synchronization, and real-time interactions between multiple users over a network.
